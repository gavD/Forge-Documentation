General tips
============

The following are some general tips to getting started with app development. This are meant to help you get up and running with a professional looking app in the shortest amount of time.

* Set a background: setting a background color or repeated image for your app is very simple, however it immediately creates a better experience for your users.
* Use :ref:`launch images <modules-launchimage>` to make the short delay while your ``index.html`` loads less noticeable to the user.
* Use :ref:`icons <modules-icons>` to make your app easier to recognise and open.
