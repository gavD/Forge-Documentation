Forge and Browser Add-ons
======================================================

The Forge platform enables you to easily and quickly write add-ons that run on multiple different browsers. With Forge:

* you are able to modify the behavior or appearance of any web page using :ref:`"content scripts"<extension-concept-content-scripts>`
* you can have long-running :ref:`"background processes"<extension-concept-background>` which co-ordinate behaviour across your whole app
* there is no need to write browser-specific code
* you do not need to understand extension development or different browser APIs
* you can access the most-used browser add-on functionality through one consistent API

This documentation contains information on how to set up your development environment, a simple tutorial to build your first Forge application and API documentation.
