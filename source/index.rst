    Creating, building, running and releasing an app is as simple as::

        > forge create
        > forge build
        > forge run
        > forge package

    If you prefer, we also offer a graphical UI to work with your apps: the `Trigger Toolkit <https://trigger.io/forge/toolkit/>`_.

    This documentation has a :ref:`getting started guide <forge-index>`, a
    reference to the available :ref:`modules <modules>`, and a couple of
    :ref:`tutorials <tutorials-weather-tutorial-1>`. Signing up and giving it a
    try is really easy: see for yourself!
