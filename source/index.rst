==========================================

Forge is a development framework which enables you to create native apps for multiple platforms from a single HTML5 codebase.

Here are a few benefits of Forge:

* Single code base
* Ability to generate mobile applications for Android and iPhone
* Ability to generate web applications for desktop and mobile browsers
* Ability to generate browser extensions for Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and IE
* Rapid development
* Reduced maintenance costs

Offering simplicity was our main goal when developing Forge: we do not require you to write a single line of Objective-C or Java, or learn platform-specific APIs.
