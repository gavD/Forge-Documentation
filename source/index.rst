.. pull-quote:: Forge makes app development as easy as web development

Creating, building, running and releasing an app is as simple as::

    > forge create
    > forge build
    > forge run
    > forge package

Or we offer a `graphical Toolkit <https://trigger.io/forge/toolkit/>`_ if you prefer!

This documentation has a :ref:`getting started guide <forge-index>`, a reference to the available :ref:`modules <modules>`, and a couple of :ref:`tutorials <tutorials-weather-tutorial-1>`. Signing up and giving it a try is really easy: `see for yourself <https://trigger.io/>`_!
