Forge Documentation
==========================================

Forge is a development framework which enables you to create native apps for multiple platforms from a single HTML5 codebase.

Here are a few benefits of Forge:

* Single code base
* Ability to generate mobile applications for Android and iPhone
* Ability to generate browser extensions for Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and IE
* Rapid development
* Reduced maintenance costs

Using Forge is quite simple and does not require you to write a single line of Objective-C or Java, or learn platform-specific APIs. You can get started by developing your app in Android or Chrome.

.. note:: You can start development in Chrome then generate native mobile apps, or start in Android then generate an iPhone app and browser add-ons. The choice is yours: both directions are supported.

Your feedback is very important to us. Please send an email to support@trigger.io with any questions or concerns.
