Forge and Mobile (iOS and Android)
=================================================

The following tutorial is intended to get anyone up to speed developing iOS and Android apps using Forge.

This process does not require you to know Objective C, Java or any platform specific API calls.
The only things needed is a basic understanding of HTML and JavaScript.

We're working hard to make Forge the simplest way to make mobile apps. We hope you'll find our guides easy to follow - 
but if you get stuck at any point, just drop us a line on support@trigger.io. We'd love to help!
