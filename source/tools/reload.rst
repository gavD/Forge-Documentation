Using Trigger.io Reload
===========================

Trigger.io Reload allows you to update the HTML, CSS and JavaScript in your app for your users without you needing to push an Appt Store update or your users needing to re-install the app.

Read about the :ref:`Reload module <modules-reload>` to enable it and :ref:`learn about the concepts <reload_concepts>`. Once you have the module enabled you can push updates to your existing users through the Toolkit UI:


How to reload an update with the Toolkit UI
---------------------------------------------

Use the Reload tab in the Toolkit to manage your streams and push updates

In this tab, you can manage your streams of users - this allows you to push different code to different users for A/B testing. By default there is a single stream which enables you to push to all users without any extra configuration.

You can also see your configurations here - how many unique users we have detected that are using your app built against which minor version of the Forge platform.

Once you have built and tested new code that you wish to deploy, you can click the 'Push to stream' link from this view in order to push the update.
